# Welcome to My Corner of the Internet

Hey there – I'm Eytan, and I'm glad you found your way here. This is where I share what I'm learning, experiencing, and thinking about as I navigate life between Portugal, Florida, and Israel.

## What You'll Find Here

I'm endlessly curious about a lot of things, and this blog is my way of making sense of it all:

**🚀 Space & Quantum Computing**: I'm fascinated by what's happening at the frontiers of science – SpaceX launches, quantum breakthroughs, the kind of stuff that makes you realize how much we still don't understand about reality itself.

**⛓️ Blockchain & Crypto**: Still learning, still exploring. I'll share what I'm figuring out about decentralized systems and where I think the real value lies, beyond the hype cycles.

**🤖 AI & Technology**: We're living through something remarkable with AI. I'm experimenting with these tools in my real estate and coaching work, and I'll share what's actually useful versus what's just impressive demos.

**📈 Markets & Investing**: Real estate, stocks, crypto – I'm actively invested and constantly learning. I'll share my perspective as someone operating across different markets and continents, though I'm definitely still figuring plenty of it out.

**🔬 Biotech & Longevity**: The intersection of biology and technology amazes me. CRISPR, new therapies, longevity research – I read everything I can find and try to understand what it means for our future.

**💪 Sports & Fitness**: Staying fit while juggling businesses and travel is an ongoing experiment. I'll share what's working for me, though I'm no elite athlete – just someone trying to optimize health and performance.

**🍽️ Food, Travel & Discoveries**: Living between cultures has exposed me to incredible food, places, and experiences. I cook at home (especially now while renovating my lake house kitchen), seek out great restaurants, and I'm always looking for hotels and destinations that offer something special. I'll share the gems I discover along the way.

## Why This Blog Exists

Writing helps me think more clearly. I've been lucky to build businesses, work across different countries, and connect with interesting people. Sharing what I learn feels like a good way to give back and connect with others on similar journeys.

I'm constantly connecting ideas across different fields – sometimes a lesson from renovating a property informs how I think about tech investments, or a great meal teaches me something about craftsmanship that applies to business. This blog is where I explore those connections.

## Let's Learn Together

I'll post regularly about what I'm discovering, experimenting with, and thinking about. Sometimes it'll be market insights, sometimes a recipe I'm proud of, sometimes a travel find, sometimes deeper dives into emerging technologies.

I don't have all the answers – not even close. But I'm curious, I'm engaged, and I'm always learning. If that resonates with you, I'd love to have you along for the ride.

Have thoughts on anything I write about? Reach out. The best insights come from conversation.

Thanks for being here.
