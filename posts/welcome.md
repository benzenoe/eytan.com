# Welcome to My Corner of the Internet

Hey there – I'm Eytan, and I'm glad you found your way here. This is where I share what I'm learning, experiencing, and thinking about as I navigate life between Portugal, Florida, and Israel.

## What You'll Find Here

I'm endlessly curious about a lot of things, and this blog is my way of making sense of it all:

**🚀 Space & Quantum Computing**: I'm fascinated by what's happening at the frontiers of science – SpaceX launches, quantum breakthroughs, the kind of stuff that makes you realize how much we still don't understand about reality itself.

**⛓️ Blockchain & Crypto**: Still learning, still exploring. I'll share what I'm figuring out about decentralized systems and where I think the real value lies, beyond the hype cycles.

**🤖 AI & Technology**: We're living through something remarkable with AI. I'm experimenting with these tools in my real estate and coaching work, and I'll share what's actually useful versus what's just impressive demos.

**📈 Markets & Investing**: Real estate, stocks, crypto – I'm actively invested and constantly learning. I'll share my perspective as someone operating across different markets and continents, though I'm definitely still figuring plenty of it out.

**💪 Sports & Fitness**: Staying fit while juggling businesses and travel is an ongoing experiment. I'll share what's working for me, though I'm no elite athlete – just someone trying to optimize health and performance.

**🍽️ Food, Travel & Discoveries**: Living between cultures has exposed me to incredible food, places, and experiences. I cook at home, seek out great restaurants, and I'm always looking for hotels and destinations that offer something special. I'll share the gems I discover along the way.

## Why This Blog Exists

Writing helps me think more clearly. I've been lucky to build businesses, work across different countries, and connect with interesting people. Sharing what I learn feels like a good way to give back and connect with others on similar journeys.

I'm constantly connecting ideas across different fields – sometimes a lesson from renovating a property informs how I think about tech investments, or a great meal teaches me something about craftsmanship that applies to business. This blog is where I explore those connections.

## Let's Learn Together

I'll post regularly about what I'm discovering, experimenting with, and thinking about. Sometimes it'll be market insights, sometimes a recipe I'm proud of, sometimes a travel find, sometimes deeper dives into emerging technologies.

I don't have all the answers – not even close. But I'm curious, I'm engaged, and I'm always learning. If that resonates with you, I'd love to have you along for the ride.

Have thoughts on anything I write about? Reach out. The best insights come from conversation.

Thanks for being here.
