# Sector Overview: Resurgence of Small Reactors and the AI Energy Wave

**Small modular reactors (SMRs)** and **microreactors** (essentially “mini” nuclear power plants) are gaining momentum as a carbon-free energy solution. In the past year, investor enthusiasm has surged due to rising electricity demand from **AI data centers** and favorable policies supporting nuclear energy.

A recent U.S. deal will deploy **up to 6 GW** of new SMR capacity in the **Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)** region—enough to power **“60 new data centers”** amid unprecedented demand from AI and tech industries.

## Why the hype wave (2024–2025)?

This convergence of:
- **AI-driven energy demand**
- **Climate / decarbonization goals**
- **Supportive policy** (streamlined licensing, fuel supply initiatives, tax credits)

…has created a nuclear “resurgence” cycle across the U.S. and Europe.

### Tech giants jumping in

- **Amazon** plans to deploy **~5 GW** of nuclear power by **2039** through partnerships including **X-energy** and utility partners.
- **Google** is working with **Kairos Power** to add **hundreds of megawatts** from advanced reactors.

### Europe (especially the U.K.)

The **U.K.** has set a goal of **24 GW** of new nuclear by **2050** and launched a competition to choose an SMR design. As of mid-2025, the U.K. selected **Rolls-Royce SMR** as the preferred technology and committed an estimated **£2.5 billion** in funding support.

### U.S. government support

The **U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)** is backing multiple advanced reactor demonstrations with multi-billion cost-sharing, while also tackling **HALEU** fuel supply (high-assay low-enriched uranium) needed for many advanced designs.

# NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) — Light-Water SMR Pioneer with First-Mover Edge

NuScale is a U.S. leader in SMRs and notably the first (and so far only) to receive **U.S. NRC design certification** for its reactor.

## Technology

- Factory-fabricated **light-water** reactor module producing **77 MWe** each (uprated from 50 MWe).
- Up to **12 modules** can be combined into one plant for scalable capacity.
- Passive safety: modules sit in a submerged pool and can self-cool without power.
- Backing from **Fluor Corp.** (majority stake), providing EPC expertise and capital support.

## Timeline & Projects

- **Romania:** agreements to deploy **six modules (462 MWe)** in **2028–2030**.

## Funding & Financials (as cited in investor coverage)

- Cash balance reported around **$489.9M** at **Q2 2025**.
- Revenue: **$8.1M in Q2 2025** (up from ~$1.0M a year prior), reflecting early progress on engineering/services.

## Market Performance (Volatility)

NuScale’s stock has been highly sensitive to:
- licensing milestones,
- large partnership announcements,
- broader “AI needs nuclear” narratives.

## Outlook & Risks

**Upside:** first-mover licensing advantage, deep backing (Fluor, DOE ecosystem), and multiple pipelines.  
**Risks:** execution delays, conversion of MOUs to binding orders, and likely future capital raises (**dilution risk**).

# Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) — Altman-Backed Microreactors Riding the AI Boom

Oklo is a Silicon Valley startup developing ultra-compact fast reactors (**Aurora**) using **metallic HALEU fuel** and a distinctive “powerhouse” concept.

## Technology

- Fast-spectrum microreactor concept scaled from **1.5 MWe** to **15 MWe**, with a **50 MWe** variant in development.
- **Build-own-operate** model: sells energy “as-a-service” rather than selling reactors.
- Long refuel interval: **10–20 years** without refueling (design intent / claims in coverage).

Readable overview image/story context:  
- [New Atlas – Oklo Aurora concept](https://newatlas.com/energy/oklo-aurora-nuclear-microreactor-idaho/)

## Timeline & Progress

- Targets first commercial unit **~2027–2028**.
- Regulatory risk: Oklo’s initial license application (for an earlier design) was denied in **2022** due to gaps; the company is regrouping.

## Partnerships & Customers (examples)

- **KHNP cooperation:** Oklo + **Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP)** agreement to cooperate on Aurora projects.

## Public market note: volatility and valuation sensitivity

Oklo’s stock has been highly volatile and narrative-driven, with coverage noting swings tied to insider selling and analyst initiations.

## Outlook & Risks

**Upside:** massive potential market (data centers, remote grids, defense) and “utility-like” recurring revenue if the build-own-operate model scales.  
**Risks:** no reactor built yet, NRC licensing uncertainty, long timeline to revenue, and likely need for substantial additional capital (**dilution risk**).
