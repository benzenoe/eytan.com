# Sector Overview: Resurgence of Small Reactors and the AI Energy Wave

Small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors – essentially “mini” nuclear power plants – are gaining momentum as a carbon-free energy solution. In the past year, investor enthusiasm has surged due to rising electricity demand from AI data centers and favorable policies supporting nuclear energy.  
(<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prnewswire.com</a>)

For example, a recent U.S. deal will deploy up to 6 GW of new SMR capacity in the Tennessee Valley Authority region, enough to power “60 new data centers” amid unprecedented demand from AI and tech industries.  
(<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prnewswire.com</a>)

Tech giants are jumping in: Amazon plans to deploy 5 GW of nuclear power by 2039 through a partnership with X-energy and utility Dominion, and Google is working with Kairos Power to add hundreds of megawatts from advanced reactors. This convergence of AI-driven energy needs, climate goals, and supportive policy (streamlined licensing, fuel supply initiatives, tax credits) has created a nuclear hype wave in 2024–2025.

From the U.S. to Europe, governments are pumping money into SMRs. The U.K. has set a goal of 24 GW of new nuclear by 2050 and launched a competition to choose an SMR design. As of mid-2025, the U.K. selected Rolls-Royce’s SMR as the preferred technology and committed an estimated £2.5 billion in funding support.

Similarly, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is backing multiple advanced reactor demonstrations with multi-billion cost-sharing, while also tackling the supply of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel needed for many designs. Recent executive orders have even directed the NRC to “streamline regulations and fast-track new licenses” for reactors.

In short, the stage is set for a new generation of nuclear startups – but turning hype into profitable reality is the big challenge. Below we analyze the key companies in the mini-reactor sector – their technology, timelines, funding, partnerships – and scrutinize recent market performance and risks. (We focus on companies investable now via public markets, but also cover prominent private players shaping the landscape.) NuScale and Oklo get extra attention given their high-profile status and volatility. We then rank which ventures are closest to revenue and which face steep hurdles like dilution or regulatory roadblocks, cutting through the optimism with a sober look at risks.

# NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) – Light-Water SMR Pioneer with First-Mover Edge

NuScale is a U.S. leader in SMRs and notably the first (and so far only) to receive U.S. NRC design certification for its reactor. Its technology is a factory-fabricated light-water reactor module producing 77 MWe each (recently uprated from 50 MWe). Up to 12 modules can be combined into one plant for scalable capacity. NuScale’s design emphasizes passive safety – the modules sit in a submerged pool and can self-cool without power. This head start in licensing gives NuScale a “clear competitive advantage” and it enjoys backing from engineering giant Fluor Corp. (which owns a majority stake), providing deep pockets and EPC expertise.

## Timeline & Projects

NuScale is targeting its first operational units by late this decade. It secured agreements to deploy six modules (462 MWe) in Romania by 2028–2030.  
(<a href="https://www.trefis.com/stock/smr/articles/575874/nuscale-stock-big-gains-bigger-risks/2025-09-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trefis.com</a>)

It is working with a U.S. utility consortium (UAMPS) on a first plant at the Idaho National Lab site (now planned as 6 modules online ~2029).

A major vote of confidence came in August 2025 when TVA and partner ENTRA1 announced a landmark plan for up to 6 GW of NuScale SMR capacity across the U.S. Southeast – “the largest SMR power commitment in U.S. history”.  
(<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tva-and-entra1-energy-announce-collaborative-agreement-in-landmark-6-gigawatt-nuscale-smr-deployment-program--largest-in-us-history-302543877.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prnewswire.com</a>)

This program envisions six SMR plants supplying TVA’s grid, enough for 4.5 million homes.  
(<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tva-and-entra1-energy-announce-collaborative-agreement-in-landmark-6-gigawatt-nuscale-smr-deployment-program--largest-in-us-history-302543877.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prnewswire.com</a>)

While still an early-stage agreement, it underscores NuScale’s frontrunner status in domestic nuclear expansion. Internationally, NuScale has additional MOUs (e.g. Poland, Kazakhstan) and interest from other countries following Romania’s lead.

## Funding & Financials

Thanks to Fluor’s support and its 2022 SPAC IPO, NuScale is capitalized for now. It ended Q2 2025 with a cash balance of $489.9 million after raising funds via its NYSE listing (ticker SMR). The company has begun to generate modest revenue from engineering services – $8.1 million in Q2 2025, up from just $1.0 million a year prior – reflecting early progress on commercial orders. Net losses remain significant (Q2 net loss of ~$0.13/share) as NuScale invests in supply chain and manufacturing setup.

The DOE has committed hefty cost-share funds (up to $1.4 billion for the Idaho project) and recently is even helping secure HALEU fuel for NuScale’s reactors. These non-dilutive supports are crucial given the high cost of bringing a first-of-kind SMR to market.

## Market Performance

NuScale’s stock has been on a rollercoaster ride, emblematic of the nuclear hype. Over the last 6–12 months, SMR shares rocketed roughly 200%, vastly outperforming the broader market. Investor optimism peaked in mid-2025 as NuScale hit milestone after milestone – NRC approval of its uprated design, that massive TVA/ENTRA1 deal, and broad political tailwinds. The stock surged from the mid-$10s into the $30–40+ range, at one point up 250%+ year-to-date. In late September 2025 it traded around $38, after a brief spike above $40.

Notably, NuScale jumped ~25% in early September on the TVA 6 GW news alone, showing how sensitive it is to big contract announcements.

However, with the stock’s rapid appreciation, Wall Street has grown more cautious on valuation. The consensus rating recently slipped to “Hold” and the average analyst 12-month price target is ~$37, essentially at the current price.  
(<a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SMR/forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketbeat.com</a>)

In other words, a lot of good news is already priced in. Any delays in converting MOUs to firm orders could prompt pullbacks.

## Outlook & Risks

NuScale is arguably closest to revenue among pure-play SMR developers, but it still faces a long road to positive cash flow. The company hopes to secure its first definitive reactor order by end of 2025 – a critical catalyst. Execution risk is high: building the first plants by 2028–30 will test NuScale’s cost estimates and supply chain. Any slippage could “hit revenue” projections and spook investors.

Likewise, the market adoption may be gradual; utilities tend to be conservative in embracing new reactors, and competition is rising (from GE Hitachi’s proven design, etc.). As a pre-profit company, NuScale will likely need to raise additional capital or bring in strategic investors within a couple of years – raising the specter of share dilution if done at lower prices.

On the bright side, its first-mover licensing advantage, strong backing (Fluor, DOE) and multiple projects in the pipeline position NuScale as a potential long-term winner in a revived nuclear industry. It’s a classic high-risk, high-reward story: NuScale’s ~$2.2 billion market cap bets on it capturing a significant slice of the future SMR market, but investors should remain cautious of near-term volatility and execution hurdles.

# Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) – Altman-Backed Microreactors Riding the AI Boom

Concept rendering of Oklo’s Aurora microreactor with its distinctive A-frame housing. Oklo’s design is compact and meant to be an attractive community hub, not a traditional industrial plant (Image: Oklo).  
(<a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/oklo-aurora-nuclear-microreactor-idaho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newatlas.com</a>)

Oklo is a Silicon Valley-born startup developing ultra-compact reactors, and it has become the hottest name in advanced fission this year. Oklo’s claim to fame is its Aurora “powerhouse”, a very small fast-spectrum reactor that uses metallic HALEU fuel and heat-pipe cooling. Originally a 1.5 MWe microreactor concept, Aurora has been scaled up to 15 MWe and even a 50 MWe variant in development.

The unit is housed in an A-frame style building (resembling a cozy alpine lodge) with an integrated supercritical CO₂ generator – a far cry from conventional concrete domes. Each Aurora can run 10–20 years without refueling.

Oklo’s business model is to build, own, and operate these reactors and sell energy “as-a-service”, rather than selling the reactors themselves. By recycling used nuclear fuel as input, Oklo also pitches itself as helping solve nuclear waste while producing power. This edgy vision attracted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has been Oklo’s chairman and lead backer since 2015.

## Timeline & Progress

Oklo aims to deploy its first commercial Aurora unit by 2027–2028. It’s already secured a site at Idaho National Lab and even broke ground on pre-construction activities. The target is to have that inaugural 15 MWe reactor online supplying customers by late 2027 (an aggressive schedule). However, Oklo must still obtain a combined license from the NRC. Its initial license application (for a 1.5 MWe design) was denied in 2022 due to gaps in the submission, so Oklo is regrouping with its larger design and a fresh application likely in 2024–25.

Regulatory risk is thus front and center – but the company is working closely with authorities and even brought in Korea’s KHNP as a partner to refine its design and licensing approach.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/oklo-khnp-to-cooperate-on-smr-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

Despite being pre-commercial, Oklo has lined up a remarkable customer pipeline. In late 2024 it signed one of the largest power purchase deals in history: a framework with data center developer Switch, Inc. to deploy up to 12 GW of Aurora reactors by 2044. This deal, though non-binding, underscores the massive interest from the tech sector in nuclear power.

Oklo will aim to gradually install dozens (eventually hundreds) of microreactors to supply Switch’s facilities, with the first units later this decade.

Likewise, the U.S. Air Force selected Oklo for a 30-year contract to build a 5 MWe microreactor at Eielson AFB, Alaska – the military’s first such project – pending regulatory approval.  
(<a href="https://www.airandspaceforces.com/air-force-microreactor-eielson-alaska/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">airandspaceforces.com</a>)  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/oklo-named-to-supply-microreactor-for-alaska-airbase" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

Oklo has also inked an MOU with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) to collaborate on manufacturing and global deployment of Aurora units (leveraging KHNP’s construction experience).  
(<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oklo-south-koreas-khnp-enter-into-agreement-develop-aurora-nuclear-facility-2025-05-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reuters.com</a>)  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/oklo-khnp-to-cooperate-on-smr-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

All told, Oklo reported a potential customer pipeline of 2,100 MW for its reactors as of late 2024. If even a fraction of this converts to revenue, Oklo could scale rapidly – but it has a lot to prove first, including actually building one.

## SPAC Merger, Funding & Partnerships

In May 2024, Oklo went public via a SPAC merger (sponsored by Sam Altman’s AltC Acquisition Corp), raising about $306 million in gross proceeds for the company. The SPAC deal valued Oklo at ~$850 million pre-money.

Post-merger, Altman and existing shareholders rolled their equity, and Oklo began trading on the NYSE under ticker OKLO. The timing was fortuitous – just as investor appetite for AI-adjacent nuclear plays exploded. With Altman’s high profile and the narrative of “nuclear batteries to power AI”, Oklo attracted intense market interest.

It doesn’t hurt that Oklo’s approach is unconventional (fast reactors, recycled fuel) and therefore carries an aura of “next-gen tech” in an industry known for conservatism.

Beyond Switch, Air Force, and KHNP, Oklo has partnerships for fuel and supply chain. It plans to build a fuel recycling facility at INL to produce its own metallic fuel from spent nuclear fuel. Oklo also partnered with Argonne National Lab on fuel testing, and received DOE awards for work on HALEU fuel recycling.

These partnerships are about de-risking the tech. Importantly, Oklo’s model of long-term power sale contracts (like the Switch PPA and Air Force PPA) should help it finance projects with predictable cash flows rather than rely on customers to buy reactors upfront.

This is a novel approach in nuclear and aligns with how large tech firms procure renewable energy.

## Stock Volatility

Oklo’s stock performance has been nothing short of astounding. In its May 2024 debut, OKLO plunged ~54% on day one to $8.45 (from the SPAC’s prior ~$14 price) as pre-deal enthusiasm reset. But from that initial trough, Oklo went on a breathtaking rally.

Over the next year, shares skyrocketed over 1,100%, making Oklo a 10-bagger and one of the market’s top performers. By September 2025, the stock was trading around $110, up ~420% just in 2025 alone.

At one point it hit an intraday high near $130, giving Oklo a fully diluted market cap around $16 billion – an extraordinary valuation for a company with no revenue yet.

What drove this mania. In a word, hype – Oklo became the poster child for the “AI needs nuclear power” story and a meme-stock among those bullish on clean tech. Every new partnership announcement (Switch’s 12 GW, the Air Force deal, etc.) and each pro-nuclear policy headline seemed to send the thinly traded stock higher.

However, volatility is extreme. In late September, Oklo stock pulled back ~18% in a week amid a wave of insider selling and the first major Wall Street rating.  
(<a href="https://coincentral.com/oklo-inc-oklo-stock-shares-slide-on-insider-selling-and-goldmans-caution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coincentral.com</a>)

Several insiders (including the CEO, CFO, and board members) sold chunks of shares, which, while planned, spooked the market.  
(<a href="https://coincentral.com/oklo-inc-oklo-stock-shares-slide-on-insider-selling-and-goldmans-caution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coincentral.com</a>)

Then Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a neutral rating and a $117 price target, cautioning that Oklo’s valuation had “run far ahead of fundamentals” and flagging its unproven technology and long road to revenue.

This one-two punch of insider sales and sober analyst commentary punctured some of the hype. Even after the dip, Oklo remains up over 1000% year-on-year, so sentiment could swing wildly on any news.

In short, Oklo has become highly speculative, trading more on story than substance at this stage.

## Outlook & Risks

There’s no denying Oklo’s bold vision and the massive upside if it executes (the Switch deal alone, if fully realized, implies hundreds of reactors and steady cash flows). Oklo is also relatively well-funded post-SPAC and has an enviable roster of allies.

But investors must grapple with fundamental risks: no reactor is built yet, no NRC license in hand, and no revenue likely until 2027+. Oklo will burn cash on development and could need to raise more capital if timelines slip – raising dilution risk down the line.

The regulatory hurdle is significant: Oklo’s fast reactor is a new type for the NRC, and the company will need to convincingly demonstrate safety to avoid the fate of its first application.

Execution risk is high too; building a first-of-kind microreactor by 2027 is a tight schedule, and any delays could erode the market’s patience given the current lofty valuation.

Furthermore, Oklo’s stock now prices in heroic outcomes. As Goldman noted, enthusiasm has been “catalyst-driven” – meaning if anticipated catalysts (like a permanent license, a new big contract, etc.) are delayed or disappoint, the stock could see sharp corrections.

In essence, Oklo offers huge upside potential (it aspires to be a profitable nuclear utility selling power across sectors) but comes with equally huge execution and valuation risk.

It’s a long-term bet that today’s nuclear renaissance truly materializes – and that Oklo will be one of its first big winners.

# TerraPower – Private Fast Reactor Venture with Gigantic Backing (Bill Gates)

TerraPower is a heavyweight in advanced nuclear, founded by Bill Gates and a cadre of scientists in 2006. While not publicly traded, it’s on every nuclear investor’s radar given its cutting-edge Natrium reactor and deep funding.

Natrium is a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor paired with an innovative molten salt heat storage system – it can flex its output to 500 MWe for peak periods by dumping heat from the salt storage to a steam generator.  
(<a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powermag.com</a>)

## Timeline & Demo Project

TerraPower, in partnership with utility PacifiCorp, is building a Natrium demonstration plant in Kemmerer, Wyoming, at the site of a retiring coal plant. Initially the target was to have it running by 2028, but a major setback hit: the specialized HALEU fuel for Natrium was supposed to come from Russia.

After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that supply was cut off, and domestic HALEU production is only just ramping up. As a result, TerraPower announced a roughly 2-year delay to 2030 for the demo plant launch.  
(<a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powermag.com</a>)

Despite this, TerraPower began early construction activities (non-nuclear infrastructure) in 2022–2023, and by 2024 it submitted its construction permit application to the NRC.  
(<a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powermag.com</a>)

Licensing is reportedly on track, and TerraPower remains confident the Kemmerer reactor will operate by 2030.  
(<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/first-terrapower-advanced-reactor-schedule-fuel-concern-2024-05-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reuters.com</a>)

The company is actively working on the HALEU issue – for instance, the DOE awarded contracts to enrichers like Centrus to domestically produce HALEU, and initial batches are expected by mid-decade.

## Funding & Partnerships

TerraPower is funded like a tech unicorn. It raised an $750 million round in 2022 (led by Gates and SK Group of Korea), on top of earlier funding, and importantly it won a $1.9 billion ARDP award from the U.S. DOE.  
(<a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powermag.com</a>)

Under this cost-share, DOE picks up half the Natrium demo cost – a huge subsidy.

The project’s engineering, procurement, and construction is being handled by Bechtel, a top nuclear EPC firm (which provides experience in managing such a first-of-a-kind build). GE Hitachi is a key technology partner (their PRISM reactor knowledge underpins Natrium). Also noteworthy: PacifiCorp (owned by Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway) is the utility hosting the demo and potentially ordering more if it succeeds.

TerraPower’s separate program, the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) with Southern Company, recently achieved operation at Idaho Lab, marking the first fission in a molten salt reactor in the U.S. – although small, it’s a stepping stone for their future designs.

These side efforts diversify TerraPower’s tech portfolio (e.g., exploring reactors for industrial heat or maritime use as hinted by the company).  
(<a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powermag.com</a>)

## Status

As a private company, TerraPower’s financials aren’t public, but it’s clearly in R&D mode – spending heavily on Natrium development and fuel cycle. It will rely on continued support from Gates (who has publicly said he’ll fund whatever it takes) and government grants to reach completion.

With the demonstration plant scheduled by 2030, revenue from selling power or additional reactors won’t flow until next decade. However, TerraPower could see near-term revenue from selling medical isotopes (it’s building facilities to produce cancer-treatment isotopes like actinium-225).

## Big Picture

TerraPower’s Natrium is one of the most advanced Gen-IV reactor projects globally, and its success or failure will heavily influence the future of fast reactors.

For investors, TerraPower isn’t directly accessible via stock yet. But one can get indirect exposure through SK (South Korea) which took a stake, or simply by investing in the nuclear supply chain companies that TerraPower contracts (like Centrus Energy for fuel, or maybe GE Hitachi’s owners).

TerraPower’s risks are largely technical and geopolitical: ensuring the sodium reactor works as intended, and securing enough fuel in time.

The company’s optimism is high – TerraPower said construction is on a “predictable schedule” with “construction complete in 2030”.  
(<a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powermag.com</a>)

Importantly, TerraPower already started groundwork at the Wyoming site and even built a test facility for full-size components and sodium handling.  
(<a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powermag.com</a>)

If it hits 2030 on target, TerraPower will have the first grid-scale advanced reactor in the U.S., potentially unlocking orders worldwide for similar plants. But if delays stretch on (e.g. fuel bottlenecks unresolved or cost overruns), it could dampen the broader advanced nuclear renaissance.

In sum, TerraPower is a high-impact venture – not one you can buy stock in today, but one that any nuclear sector investor should monitor closely.

# X-energy – High-Temperature Modular Reactors with Big Deals (Private, Plan to Go Public)

X-energy is another U.S. advanced reactor firm making waves, focused on HTGR (High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors). Its signature design, the Xe-100, is an 80 MWe pebble-bed reactor that can be deployed in packs of four (4×80 MWe = 320 MWe plant). The Xe-100 uses TRISO fuel (tiny uranium fuel pebbles encapsulated for safety) and outputs high-temperature heat (~600°C) in addition to power, making it useful for industrial processes or hydrogen production.

X-energy has strong government support: it was a co-winner of the DOE’s ARDP demo funding (awarded ~$1.2 billion) to build four Xe-100 units in Washington state by 2030.

## Timeline & Projects

The ARDP demonstration is in collaboration with Energy Northwest (a consortium of utilities) and is slated for the Hanford site in Washington, aiming for operation around 2028–2030.

X-energy hit a licensing milestone in March 2025 by submitting a Construction Permit application to the NRC for its first unit(s). The NRC has since docketed the application and even set an accelerated 18-month review schedule – notably cutting the typical timeline in half.

However, it’s reported that Dow, X-energy’s major private-sector partner, likely won’t give a final go-ahead on building the plant until 2028 after seeing more progress. That partner is Dow Inc., the chemical industry giant.

In 2022, X-energy and Dow announced plans to deploy a four-pack of Xe-100 reactors at one of Dow’s Gulf Coast manufacturing sites (in Seadrift, Texas) to provide process heat and power.

In June 2025 the NRC also accepted the construction permit application for this Dow/X-energy plant. The goal is to have it running by around 2030. If successful, it could kick off a fleet of SMRs for industrial decarbonization.

X-energy also landed a headline-grabbing deal with Amazon in 2024. Amazon, along with utility partner Constellation and X-energy, announced plans to develop up to 5 GW of nuclear power by 2039 to supply Amazon’s operations.

This was announced alongside Amazon signing a PPA with Constellation to keep an existing Illinois nuclear plant online, showing Amazon’s multi-pronged nuclear strategy.  
(<a href="https://www.powermag.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powermag.com</a>)

The Amazon-X-energy partnership underscores how demand for clean energy from tech firms is catalyzing SMR projects.

Additionally, X-energy has an agreement with Dominion Energy (a major utility) to look at SMRs for Virginia, and an MOU with Ontario Power for potential deployments in Canada.

Internationally, it’s exploring opportunities in places like Romania and Jordan for its reactor, though those are in early stages.

## Funding & Path to Public Market

X-energy has raised substantial private capital. It had planned to go public via a SPAC merger with Ares Acquisition Corp in 2023 at a $2 billion valuation. However, by late 2023 that SPAC deal was mutually terminated amid challenging market conditions for new listings.

Instead, X-energy reportedly secured about $120 million in private financing as a bridge in early 2024 to carry on operations. The company still intends to pursue a public listing when conditions improve (possibly via another SPAC or IPO in 2025).

Financially, X-energy will need significant capital to build its projects – the ARDP demo cost is on the order of $2.5 billion (half to be covered by DOE). Likewise, the Dow project will be capital intensive.

X-energy also owns TRISO-X, a subsidiary building a TRISO fuel fabrication facility in Tennessee. This is crucial for its fuel supply and could become a revenue stream if it sells TRISO fuel to other reactor operators in the future.

## Outlook & Risks

X-energy has positioned itself as a leader in the high-temperature reactor niche, which complements what NuScale and GE Hitachi are doing with water-cooled SMRs. Its MOUs with industrial users (Dow) and data center operators (Amazon) give it a strong story: these reactors can serve markets beyond just utilities.

If all goes to plan, X-energy’s first reactors will be operating by the end of this decade, and it could ramp up production in the 2030s.

The risks are typical of an advanced reactor startup: technology, licensing, and funding.

From an investment perspective, the termination of the SPAC was a setback, but also maybe a blessing – it avoided going public in a weak market.

When X-energy does list, it will bring a significant pipeline – arguably one of the more concrete order books in the SMR space.

# Rolls-Royce SMR – The U.K.’s Contender (Rolls-Royce Holdings plc)

Rolls-Royce SMR is a subsidiary of the famed British engineering firm Rolls-Royce plc (LSE: RR., also traded as RYCEY in the U.S.). While Rolls-Royce is known for jet engines, it has decades of nuclear expertise (they build reactors for the Royal Navy’s submarines).

Leveraging that know-how, Rolls spun up an SMR division in 2017 to design a 470 MWe pressurized-water reactor. This SMR uses proven PWR technology but packaged in a compact, factory-fabricated format. Each plant would produce ~1 GW thermal / 470 MW electric and run for 60+ years.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

## Funding & Government Support

Rolls-Royce SMR received £210 million in U.K. government grants in 2021 and raised £280 million from private investors. This £490 M funded the design through the basic design phase and the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process with U.K. regulators.

The U.K. government recently made a landmark commitment: in June 2025 it selected Rolls-Royce SMR as the “preferred bidder” in its SMR competition, earmarking roughly £2.5 billion to support the first rolls-out of Rolls SMRs.

Under the plan, Great British Energy (a new government-backed entity) will form a joint venture with Rolls to build the first set of at least three SMR units in the U.K.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/rolls-royce-smr-named-as-uks-selected-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

The goal is to have the first unit operational by the early 2030s (grid connection in mid-2030s and a final investment decision by 2029).  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/rolls-royce-smr-named-as-uks-selected-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

Rolls-Royce SMR has stated that deploying just three units in the U.K. will create thousands of jobs and significant industrial regeneration.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/rolls-royce-smr-named-as-uks-selected-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

Beyond the U.K., export opportunities are a big part of the thesis. Rolls has MOUs or interest from ~10 countries.

Notably, ČEZ in the Czech Republic selected Rolls’ SMR for up to 3 GW of new nuclear (around 6 units).  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

Rolls is also shortlisted in the Netherlands and was in Sweden’s recent SMR considerations.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

## Technology & Status

Rolls’ design is currently in Phase 2 of the U.K.’s GDA regulatory review. It expects to clear GDA by 2026.

In parallel, Rolls is securing sites and eyeing old nuclear sites. It has also announced plans for a factory in Sheffield to manufacture reactor modules.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

The Rolls SMR is designed to have 90% of its components made in factories, with only assembly on-site.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

Rolls estimates each 470 MW plant will cost around £2 billion once in serial production.

## Market Performance

Rolls-Royce’s stock has been on a tear lately. Over the last year, RR. shares have more than doubled (up ~120% YoY).  
(<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/rr:ln" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tradingeconomics.com</a>)

In the past 6 months alone, the stock is up about 50%.  
(<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/rr:ln" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tradingeconomics.com</a>)

In September 2025 Rolls-Royce stock reached around 1,190 pence.

## Risks & Outlook

Risks include cost escalation and timing. The plan is to make a final investment decision by 2029 and have power on grid by mid-2030s.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/rolls-royce-smr-named-as-uks-selected-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

Competitive risk exists if other designs succeed sooner and cheaper. On the positive side, Rolls-Royce SMR is arguably the furthest along among SMR developers in securing actual orders.

# GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy – Deploying the First Grid SMRs (via GE & Hitachi)

GE Hitachi (GEH) is a joint venture between General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Japan’s Hitachi, and it’s a quiet but major player in the SMR race. GEH’s design – the BWRX-300, a 300 MWe boiling water reactor – may well become the first operational SMR in the West. It’s based on decades-old boiling water reactor tech and aims to reduce cost.

## Key Projects & Timeline

The flagship project is in Canada. Ontario Power Generation (OPG) is constructing a BWRX-300 at its Darlington nuclear site near Toronto, slated to come online in 2028.

Next, Poland. ORLEN Synthos has committed to buy several BWRX-300 reactors, targeting the first unit by 2029 with potentially a fleet after that.

GE Hitachi also signed on to deploy a BWRX-300 in Sweden and has interest in Estonia. In the U.S., GEH teamed up with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) as well.

## Funding & Structure

GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy itself is not a separate public company. GE (through GE Vernova, its energy division) holds ~80%, Hitachi ~20%.

## Status & Outlook

The BWRX-300 is arguably the closest to real revenue and operation. It also benefits from using standard low-enriched uranium fuel, reducing fuel supply risk compared to HALEU-dependent designs.

# Kairos Power – Fluoride Salt Reactor Pioneer (Private)

Kairos Power is a U.S. startup working on a fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR). It operates at high temperature but low pressure, with solid fuel and molten fluoride salt as coolant.

## Timeline & Demo

Kairos is building a demonstration reactor named Hermes in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. It received the first NRC construction permit for an advanced (non-LWR) reactor in Dec 2023. By May 2025, Kairos poured the first nuclear safety-related concrete for Hermes.

Hermes is expected to go critical around 2026–2027, providing operational data. If successful, Kairos plans a scaled-up commercial reactor in the early 2030s.

## Funding & Partnerships

Kairos has raised on the order of $600+ million, including DOE awards. Google has also invested and partnered with Kairos for future deployments.

Risks include materials corrosion, first-of-kind licensing, and competition by the time it aims to commercialize.

---

# Other Notables & International Players

Beyond the big names above, a few other companies are on the mini-reactor radar.

## Ultra Safe Nuclear Corp (USNC) / Standard Nuclear

USNC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late 2024. Its assets were acquired in 2025 by Standard Nuclear for ~$28 million.

## Newcleo (France/U.K.)

Newcleo is Europe’s biggest nuclear startup working on lead-cooled fast reactors. It has raised over €500 M but faced financing struggles and reduced U.K. activity.

## Westinghouse Electric – AP300 SMR

Westinghouse unveiled the AP300 in 2023 and withdrew from the U.K. SMR competition in 2024.  
(<a href="https://neutronbytes.com/2025/04/27/uk-smr-competition-may-unravel-over-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neutronbytes.com</a>)

## Holtec International – SMR-160

Holtec remains private and is pursuing deployments, but timelines remain unclear.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/rolls-royce-smr-named-as-uks-selected-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

## Last Energy

Last Energy offers a 20 MWe micro PWR and focuses on PPAs. It is venture-funded and not publicly investable.

## Fusion Firms

Fusion hype also amplified broader “nuclear” sentiment, though fusion remains farther from commercialization.

# Ranking: Who’s Nearest to Revenue & Viability

Taking stock of all these companies, none are yet generating significant reactor sales revenue – but some are very close.

## GE Hitachi (BWRX-300) – Closest to revenue

It has actual reactor orders under execution (Canada, Poland) with deliveries by 2028.

## NuScale (SMR) – Next closest

NuScale is already earning small revenues and aims to secure firm orders by end of 2025.  
(<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tva-and-entra1-energy-announce-collaborative-agreement-in-landmark-6-gigawatt-nuscale-smr-deployment-program--largest-in-us-history-302543877.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prnewswire.com</a>)

## Rolls-Royce SMR – Close, but later timeline

It has government-backed projects, with first units expected in early-to-mid 2030s.  
(<a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/rolls-royce-smr-named-as-uks-selected-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world-nuclear-news.org</a>)

## Oklo – High upside, high risk

Oklo has PPAs but no license and no revenue until 2027+. Insiders selling and valuation risk remain key.  
(<a href="https://coincentral.com/oklo-inc-oklo-stock-shares-slide-on-insider-selling-and-goldmans-caution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coincentral.com</a>)

## X-energy – Moderate risk, steady progress

Private, with DOE support, Dow project, and Amazon partnership.

## TerraPower – Well-funded, long-term

Delayed due to HALEU supply constraints.  
(<a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">powermag.com</a>)  
(<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/first-terrapower-advanced-reactor-schedule-fuel-concern-2024-05-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reuters.com</a>)

## Holtec, Newcleo, others – Farthest from revenue

Newcleo is in financial peril without new funding. USNC already went bankrupt.

# Dilution and Capital Risk Summary

For publicly traded ones (or soon-to-be):

- NuScale: likely needs more capital before breakeven.
- Oklo: almost certain to dilute given capex needs.
- Rolls-Royce: lower dilution risk due to government and parent cash flow.
- X-energy: will likely raise funds at IPO; partner financing may reduce dilution.

---

# Regulatory and Execution Risks

A common risk is regulatory delays. NRC timelines can slip. Companies doing first-of-kind designs face steeper learning curves with regulators. Execution is another major risk; nuclear builds have historically struggled with cost and schedule.

---

# Conclusion: Hype vs. Reality in the Nuclear Renaissance

The narrative that “nuclear is back” – driven by energy security needs, climate goals, and the insatiable power demands of AI – has real substance.

However, investors must disentangle hype from reality. Some valuations run far ahead of achievements. Analysts urge caution. For NuScale, analysts have largely moved to Hold, noting the stock’s price now factors in much of the foreseeable good news.  
(<a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SMR/forecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marketbeat.com</a>)

Positive catalysts could send stocks soaring further, while negative news could trigger sharp sell-offs. This sector is volatile and long-cycle by nature.

The mini-nuclear gold rush has begun; which companies strike gold will become clearer with each passing quarter of progress (or lack thereof).
