Mastering Your Sphere of Influence in Real Estate

When it comes to real estate success, the most powerful tool in your arsenal isn’t cold leads or expensive ads — it’s your sphere of influence (SOI). Studies show that 75–90% of top agents’ business comes from their existing relationships. Yet, many agents fail to nurture these connections effectively.

If you’re not staying top of mind, someone else is. Let’s break down how you can master your SOI marketing and create a sustainable pipeline of referrals and repeat business.

Why Your Sphere of Influence Matters

Your SOI includes:

Family, friends, and acquaintances who trust you

Past clients who already know your value

Local community members who recognize your brand

Industry contacts who can refer business your way

Even your closest connections won’t automatically think of you for real estate unless you consistently remind them through engagement, value, and presence.

The Law of CRAP: A System for SOI Success

To build a strong SOI strategy, use the Law of CRAP:

Capture – Identify and document potential sphere members in a CRM.
Reward – Provide value through useful insights, thoughtful gifts, or meaningful interactions.
Automate – Set up systems for regular check-ins, follow-ups, and touchpoints.
Plan – Develop a structured approach for deepening key relationships.

Timing Is Everything: The 80/20 Rule for Calls

Your SOI outreach should be strategic. Research shows that the best times to reach people are:

7:30–8:30 AM (before the day starts)

5:30–6:30 PM (winding down before dinner)

These two time slots alone yield most successful connections. Maximize your outreach by focusing on these golden windows.

Your SOI Is Your Future Business

The difference between success and failure in real estate is often just one inch — a single missed conversation, an ignored follow-up, or a neglected relationship. By implementing these simple yet highly effective SOI marketing strategies, you can create a consistent stream of business without chasing cold leads.
