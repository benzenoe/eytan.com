# Eytan.com Frontend - Quick Reference

**Last Updated:** December 8, 2025 (Session 3)

## This Repository

**Frontend for eytan.com** - Static site hosted on GitHub Pages

- **URL:** https://eytan.com
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/benzenoe/eytan.com.git
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (deploys automatically from main branch)
- **Deployment time:** 1-2 minutes after push

## Related Repositories

- **Backend API:** `C:\Users\eytan_s9t3al\Documents\test-claude\blog-backend`
  - GitHub: https://github.com/benzenoe/eytan-com-blog-backend.git
  - Hosted on: Railway (https://api.eytan.com)

## How It Works

1. **Blog listing** (`blog.html`) → Fetches posts from API: `https://api.eytan.com/api/posts?status=published`
2. **Individual posts** (`blog-post.html`) → Fetches from API + loads markdown from `posts/{post-id}.md`
3. **Admin panel** (`admin.html`) → Manages posts via API

## Key Files

- `blog.html` - Blog listing page
- `blog-post.html` - Individual post page
- `admin.html` - Admin panel
- `js/blog.js` - Blog listing logic
- `js/blog-post.js` - Post display logic
- `js/admin.js` - Admin panel logic (updated with image upload API - lines 369-427)
- `data/blog-posts.json` - Post metadata (auto-generated by backend)
- `posts/{post-id}.md` - Post content (auto-generated by backend)
- `images/blog/` - Uploaded blog images (NEW - Dec 7, 2025)

## Image Upload System (NEW - Dec 7, 2025)

**How it works:**
- Admin uploads image in `admin.html` → JavaScript calls `POST https://api.eytan.com/api/upload/image`
- Backend uploads to `images/blog/{timestamp}-{filename}` in this repo
- Returns URL like `/images/blog/1733550123-photo.jpg`
- Database stores URL (NOT base64!)
- Images served from GitHub Pages (fast, cached)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No database corruption
- ✅ 2MB max enforced by API
- ✅ Fast loading via CDN

**Code:** `js/admin.js` lines 369-427

## Common Fixes

### Posts not showing after publish
```bash
# User needs to hard refresh browser:
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)

# Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy
```

### Edit buttons grayed out
Check `js/admin.js` line 69 - should NOT have `disabled` attribute:
```javascript
<button class="btn-icon btn-edit" onclick="editPost('${post.id}')" title="Edit">
```

### Deployment
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description"
git push
# GitHub Pages auto-deploys in 1-2 minutes
```

## Session History

### Session 3 (Dec 8, 2025)
**Issue:** Post "test4" showing "Post Not Found" on live site

**Root cause:** Inconsistent markdown file directories
- System had both `posts/` and `blog/` directories
- Frontend loaded from `blog/` which had incorrect content
- Backend republish script used `posts/` which had correct content

**Fix implemented:**
- ✅ Updated `js/blog-post.js` to load from `posts/` directory (line 87)
- ✅ Removed deprecated `blog/` directory
- ✅ Backend now publishes to `posts/` directory only
- ✅ System now standardized on single directory structure

**Files modified:**
- `js/blog-post.js` - Changed fetch path from blog/ to posts/
- `blog/` directory - Removed (deprecated)
