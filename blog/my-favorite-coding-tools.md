# My Favorite Coding Tools

As developers, our tools can significantly impact our productivity and workflow. Here are some of my favorite tools that I use daily.

## Code Editors

### Visual Studio Code
My go-to editor for most projects. It's fast, extensible, and has an amazing ecosystem of extensions.

**Must-have extensions:**
- ESLint - Code linting
- Prettier - Code formatting
- GitLens - Enhanced Git integration
- Live Server - Local development server

## Terminal & Command Line

### iTerm2 (macOS) / Windows Terminal
A better terminal experience with features like split panes, search, and customization.

### Oh My Zsh
Makes working with the command line more pleasant with themes, plugins, and helpful shortcuts.

## Version Control

### Git + GitHub
Essential for version control and collaboration. Learn Git well - it's one of the most important skills for developers.

**Key commands I use daily:**
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
git pull
```

## Browser Developer Tools

Modern browsers have powerful built-in developer tools. Learn to use them effectively:

- **Chrome DevTools**: Debugging, performance analysis, network inspection
- **Firefox Developer Tools**: Great CSS grid and flexbox inspection tools

## Productivity Tools

### Notion
For documentation, note-taking, and project planning. It's incredibly flexible.

### Figma
For design and UI mockups before coding. Even if you're not a designer, it helps to visualize what you're building.

## Learning Resources

### Stack Overflow
When you're stuck, chances are someone else has been too. This is the developer's best friend.

### Documentation Sites
- MDN Web Docs for web standards
- Official documentation for frameworks and libraries you use

## Package Managers

### npm / yarn
For managing JavaScript dependencies. Understanding package management is crucial for modern development.

## Testing Tools

### Jest
My preferred testing framework for JavaScript. Write tests to ensure your code works as expected.

## Conclusion

These tools make my development workflow smoother and more efficient. However, remember that tools are just that - tools. What matters most is your problem-solving skills and understanding of core concepts.

Start simple, and gradually add tools to your workflow as you identify needs. Don't try to use everything at once!
