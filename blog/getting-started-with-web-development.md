# Getting Started with Web Development

Are you interested in becoming a web developer but don't know where to start? This guide will help you navigate the beginning of your journey.

## The Foundation: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Every web developer needs to master these three core technologies:

### HTML (Structure)
HTML provides the structure and content of web pages. It's like the skeleton of a website.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Style)
CSS is responsible for the visual presentation and layout of your web pages.

```css
h1 {
    color: #667eea;
    font-size: 2rem;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### JavaScript (Interactivity)
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your websites.

```javascript
document.querySelector('h1').addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert('Hello!');
});
```

## Learning Resources

Here are some excellent (and free!) resources to get started:

- **freeCodeCamp**: Comprehensive curriculum with hands-on projects
- **MDN Web Docs**: The definitive reference for web technologies
- **JavaScript.info**: In-depth JavaScript tutorials
- **CSS-Tricks**: Everything you need to know about CSS

## Build Projects

The best way to learn is by building. Start with simple projects:

1. Personal portfolio website
2. Todo list application
3. Weather app using an API
4. Blog or content management system

## Stay Consistent

Learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint. Set aside time each day to practice, even if it's just 30 minutes.

## Join the Community

Connect with other developers:

- Participate in online forums like Stack Overflow
- Join Discord servers and Slack communities
- Attend local meetups or virtual events
- Share your projects on GitHub

*Remember: Every expert was once a beginner. Keep learning, keep building, and don't give up!*
