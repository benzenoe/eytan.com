                    <h1 id="sector-overview-resurgence-of-small-reactors-and-the-ai-energy-wave">Sector Overview: Resurgence of Small Reactors and the AI Energy Wave</h1>
<p><strong>Small modular reactors (SMRs)</strong> and <strong>microreactors</strong> – essentially “mini” nuclear power plants – are gaining momentum as a carbon-free energy solution. In the past year, investor enthusiasm has surged due to rising electricity demand from AI data centers and favorable policies supporting nuclear energy<br><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/">prnewswire.com</a>.</p>
<p>For example, a recent U.S. deal will deploy up to <strong>6 GW</strong> of new SMR capacity in the <strong>Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)</strong> region, enough to power “<strong>60 new data centers</strong>” amid unprecedented demand from AI and tech industries<br><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tva-and-entra1-energy-announce-collaborative-agreement-in-landmark-6-gigawatt-nuscale-smr-deployment-program--largest-in-us-history-302543877.html">prnewswire.com</a>.</p>
<p>Tech giants are jumping in: <strong>Amazon plans to deploy 5 GW of nuclear power by 2039</strong> through a partnership with <strong>X-energy</strong> and utility <strong>Dominion</strong>, and <strong>Google</strong> is working with <strong>Kairos Power</strong> to add hundreds of megawatts from advanced reactors. This convergence of AI-driven energy needs, climate goals, and supportive policy (streamlined licensing, fuel supply initiatives, tax credits) has created a nuclear hype wave in <strong>2024–2025</strong>.</p>
<p>From the U.S. to Europe, governments are pumping money into SMRs. The <strong>U.K.</strong> has set a goal of <strong>24 GW of new nuclear by 2050</strong> and launched a competition to choose an SMR design. As of mid-2025, the U.K. selected <strong>Rolls-Royce’s SMR</strong> as the preferred technology and committed an estimated <strong>£2.5 billion</strong> in funding support. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is backing multiple advanced reactor demonstrations with multi-billion cost-sharing, while also tackling the supply of <strong>high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU)</strong> fuel needed for many designs. Recent executive orders have even directed the NRC to “streamline regulations and fast-track new licenses” for reactors.</p>
<p>In short, the stage is set for a new generation of nuclear startups – but turning hype into profitable reality is the big challenge. Below we analyze the key companies in the mini-reactor sector – their technology, timelines, funding, partnerships – and scrutinize recent market performance and risks. (We focus on companies investable now via public markets, but also cover prominent private players shaping the landscape.) <strong>NuScale</strong> and <strong>Oklo</strong> get extra attention given their high-profile status and volatility. We then rank which ventures are closest to revenue and which face steep hurdles like dilution or regulatory roadblocks, cutting through the optimism with a sober look at risks.</p>

<h1 id="nuscale-power-nyse-smr--light-water-smr-pioneer-with-first-mover-edge">NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR) – Light-Water SMR Pioneer with First-Mover Edge</h1>
<p><em>Rendering of an advanced NuScale SMR plant. NuScale’s VOYGR facility houses multiple small reactor modules (Image: NuScale Power).</em></p>
<p>NuScale is a U.S. leader in SMRs and notably the first (and so far only) to receive U.S. NRC design certification for its reactor. Its technology is a factory-fabricated light-water reactor module producing <strong>77 MWe</strong> each (recently uprated from 50 MWe). Up to 12 modules can be combined into one plant for scalable capacity. NuScale’s design emphasizes passive safety – the modules sit in a submerged pool and can self-cool without power. This head start in licensing gives NuScale a “clear competitive advantage” and it enjoys backing from engineering giant <strong>Fluor Corp.</strong> (which owns a majority stake), providing deep pockets and EPC expertise.</p>
<h2 id="timeline--projects">Timeline &amp; Projects</h2>
<p>NuScale is targeting its first operational units by late this decade. It secured agreements to deploy six modules (462 MWe) in Romania by <strong>2028–2030</strong><br><a href="https://www.trefis.com/stock/smr/articles/575874/nuscale-stock-big-gains-bigger-risks/2025-09-25">trefis.com</a>,<br>and is working with a U.S. utility consortium (<strong>UAMPS</strong>) on a first plant at the Idaho National Lab site (now planned as 6 modules online ~2029).</p>
<p>A major vote of confidence came in <strong>August 2025</strong> when TVA and partner <strong>ENTRA1</strong> announced a landmark plan for up to <strong>6 GW</strong> of NuScale SMR capacity across the U.S. Southeast – “the largest SMR power commitment in U.S. history”<br><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tva-and-entra1-energy-announce-collaborative-agreement-in-landmark-6-gigawatt-nuscale-smr-deployment-program--largest-in-us-history-302543877.html">prnewswire.com</a>.<br>This program envisions six SMR plants supplying TVA’s grid, enough for <strong>4.5 million homes</strong><br><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tva-and-entra1-energy-announce-collaborative-agreement-in-landmark-6-gigawatt-nuscale-smr-deployment-program--largest-in-us-history-302543877.html">prnewswire.com</a>.</p>
<p>While still an early-stage agreement, it underscores NuScale’s frontrunner status in domestic nuclear expansion. Internationally, NuScale has additional MOUs (e.g. Poland, Kazakhstan) and interest from other countries following Romania’s lead.</p>
<h2 id="funding--financials">Funding &amp; Financials</h2>
<p>Thanks to Fluor’s support and its 2022 SPAC IPO, NuScale is capitalized for now. It ended Q2 2025 with a cash balance of <strong>$489.9 million</strong> after raising funds via its NYSE listing (ticker SMR). The company has begun to generate modest revenue from engineering services – <strong>$8.1 million in Q2 2025</strong>, up from just <strong>$1.0 million</strong> a year prior – reflecting early progress on commercial orders. Net losses remain significant (Q2 net loss of ~$0.13/share) as NuScale invests in supply chain and manufacturing setup.</p>
<p>The DOE has committed hefty cost-share funds (up to <strong>$1.4 billion</strong> for the Idaho project) and recently is even helping secure HALEU fuel for NuScale’s reactors. These non-dilutive supports are crucial given the high cost of bringing a first-of-kind SMR to market.</p>
<h2 id="market-performance">Market Performance</h2>
<p>NuScale’s stock has been on a rollercoaster ride, emblematic of the nuclear hype. Over the last 6–12 months, SMR shares rocketed roughly <strong>200%</strong>, vastly outperforming the broader market. Investor optimism peaked in mid-2025 as NuScale hit milestone after milestone – NRC approval of its uprated design, that massive TVA/ENTRA1 deal, and broad political tailwinds.</p>
<p>The stock surged from the mid-$10s into the $30–40+ range, at one point up 250%+ year-to-date. In late September 2025 it traded around <strong>$38</strong>, after a brief spike above <strong>$40</strong>. Notably, NuScale jumped ~25% in early September on the TVA 6 GW news alone, showing how sensitive it is to big contract announcements.</p>
<p>However, with the stock’s rapid appreciation, Wall Street has grown more cautious on valuation. The consensus rating recently slipped to “Hold” and the average analyst 12-month price target is <strong>~$37</strong>, essentially at the current price<br><a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SMR/forecast/">marketbeat.com</a>.<br>In other words, a lot of good news is already priced in. Any delays in converting MOUs to firm orders could prompt pullbacks.</p>
<h2 id="outlook--risks">Outlook &amp; Risks</h2>
<p>NuScale is arguably closest to revenue among pure-play SMR developers, but it still faces a long road to positive cash flow. The company hopes to secure its first definitive reactor order by end of <strong>2025</strong> – a critical catalyst.</p>
<p>Execution risk is high: building the first plants by 2028–30 will test NuScale’s cost estimates and supply chain. Any slippage could “hit revenue” projections and spook investors. Likewise, the market adoption may be gradual; utilities tend to be conservative in embracing new reactors, and competition is rising (from GE Hitachi’s proven design, etc.).</p>
<p>As a pre-profit company, NuScale will likely need to raise additional capital or bring in strategic investors within a couple of years – raising the specter of share dilution if done at lower prices.</p>
<p>On the bright side, its first-mover licensing advantage, strong backing (Fluor, DOE) and multiple projects in the pipeline position NuScale as a potential long-term winner in a revived nuclear industry. It’s a classic high-risk, high-reward story: NuScale’s ~$2.2 billion market cap bets on it capturing a significant slice of the future SMR market, but investors should remain cautious of near-term volatility and execution hurdles.</p>

<h1 id="oklo-inc-nyse-oklo--altman-backed-microreactors-riding-the-ai-boom">Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) – Altman-Backed Microreactors Riding the AI Boom</h1>
<p><em>Concept rendering of Oklo’s Aurora microreactor with its distinctive A-frame housing. Oklo’s design is compact and meant to be an attractive community hub, not a traditional industrial plant (Image: Oklo).</em><br><a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/oklo-aurora-nuclear-microreactor-idaho/">newatlas.com</a>  </p>
<p>Oklo is a Silicon Valley-born startup developing ultra-compact reactors, and it has become the hottest name in advanced fission this year. Oklo’s claim to fame is its Aurora “powerhouse”, a very small fast-spectrum reactor that uses metallic HALEU fuel and heat-pipe cooling. Originally a 1.5 MWe microreactor concept, Aurora has been scaled up to 15 MWe and even a 50 MWe variant in development.</p>
<p>The unit is housed in an A-frame style building (resembling a cozy alpine lodge) with an integrated supercritical CO₂ generator – a far cry from conventional concrete domes. Each Aurora can run 10–20 years without refueling.</p>
<p>Oklo’s business model is to build, own, and operate these reactors and sell energy “as-a-service”, rather than selling the reactors themselves. By recycling used nuclear fuel as input, Oklo also pitches itself as helping solve nuclear waste while producing power. This edgy vision attracted OpenAI CEO <strong>Sam Altman</strong>, who has been Oklo’s chairman and lead backer since 2015.</p>
<h2 id="timeline--progress">Timeline &amp; Progress</h2>
<p>Oklo aims to deploy its first commercial Aurora unit by <strong>2027–2028</strong>. It’s already secured a site at Idaho National Lab and even broke ground on pre-construction activities. The target is to have that inaugural 15 MWe reactor online supplying customers by late 2027 (an aggressive schedule).</p>
<p>However, Oklo must still obtain a combined license from the NRC. Its initial license application (for a 1.5 MWe design) was denied in 2022 due to gaps in the submission, so Oklo is regrouping with its larger design and a fresh application likely in 2024–25.</p>
<p>Regulatory risk is thus front and center – but the company is working closely with authorities and even brought in Korea’s KHNP as a partner to refine its design and licensing approach<br><a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/oklo-khnp-to-cooperate-on-smr-projects">world-nuclear-news.org</a>.</p>
<p>Despite being pre-commercial, Oklo has lined up a remarkable customer pipeline. In late 2024 it signed one of the largest power purchase deals in history: a framework with data center developer Switch, Inc. to deploy up to 12 GW of Aurora reactors by 2044. This deal, though non-binding, underscores the massive interest from the tech sector in nuclear power.</p>
<p>Oklo will aim to gradually install dozens (eventually hundreds) of microreactors to supply Switch’s facilities, with the first units later this decade.</p>
<p>Likewise, the U.S. Air Force selected Oklo for a 30-year contract to build a 5 MWe microreactor at Eielson AFB, Alaska – the military’s first such project – pending regulatory approval<br><a href="https://www.airandspaceforces.com/air-force-microreactor-eielson-alaska/">airandspaceforces.com</a><br><a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/oklo-named-to-supply-microreactor-for-alaska-airbase">world-nuclear-news.org</a>.</p>
<p>Oklo has also inked an MOU with Korea Hydro &amp; Nuclear Power (KHNP) to collaborate on manufacturing and global deployment of Aurora units (leveraging KHNP’s construction experience)<br><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oklo-south-koreas-khnp-enter-into-agreement-develop-aurora-nuclear-facility-2025-05-27/">reuters.com</a><br><a href="https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/articles/oklo-khnp-to-cooperate-on-smr-projects">world-nuclear-news.org</a>.</p>
<p>All told, Oklo reported a potential customer pipeline of 2,100 MW for its reactors as of late 2024. If even a fraction of this converts to revenue, Oklo could scale rapidly – but it has a lot to prove first, including actually building one.</p>
<h2 id="spac-merger-funding--partnerships">SPAC Merger, Funding &amp; Partnerships</h2>
<p>In May 2024, Oklo went public via a SPAC merger (sponsored by Sam Altman’s AltC Acquisition Corp), raising about $306 million in gross proceeds for the company. The SPAC deal valued Oklo at ~$850 million pre-money. Post-merger, Altman and existing shareholders rolled their equity, and Oklo began trading on the NYSE under ticker OKLO.</p>
<p>The timing was fortuitous – just as investor appetite for AI-adjacent nuclear plays exploded. With Altman’s high profile and the narrative of “nuclear batteries to power AI”, Oklo attracted intense market interest. It doesn’t hurt that Oklo’s approach is unconventional (fast reactors, recycled fuel) and therefore carries an aura of “next-gen tech” in an industry known for conservatism.</p>
<p>Beyond Switch, Air Force, and KHNP, Oklo has partnerships for fuel and supply chain. It plans to build a fuel recycling facility at INL to produce its own metallic fuel from spent nuclear fuel. Oklo also partnered with Argonne National Lab on fuel testing, and received DOE awards for work on HALEU fuel recycling.</p>
<p>These partnerships are about de-risking the tech. Importantly, Oklo’s model of long-term power sale contracts (like the Switch PPA and Air Force PPA) should help it finance projects with predictable cash flows rather than rely on customers to buy reactors upfront. This is a novel approach in nuclear and aligns with how large tech firms procure renewable energy.</p>
<h2 id="stock-volatility">Stock Volatility</h2>
<p>Oklo’s stock performance has been nothing short of astounding. In its May 2024 debut, OKLO plunged ~54% on day one to $8.45 (from the SPAC’s prior ~$14 price) as pre-deal enthusiasm reset. But from that initial trough, Oklo went on a breathtaking rally.</p>
<p>Over the next year, shares skyrocketed over 1,100%, making Oklo a 10-bagger and one of the market’s top performers. By September 2025, the stock was trading around $110, up ~420% just in 2025 alone. At one point it hit an intraday high near $130, giving Oklo a fully diluted market cap around $16 billion – an extraordinary valuation for a company with no revenue yet.</p>
<p>What drove this mania? In a word, hype – Oklo became the poster child for the “AI needs nuclear power” story and a meme-stock among those bullish on clean tech. Every new partnership announcement (Switch’s 12 GW, the Air Force deal, etc.) and each pro-nuclear policy headline seemed to send the thinly traded stock higher.</p>
<p>However, volatility is extreme. In late September, Oklo stock pulled back ~18% in a week amid a wave of insider selling and the first major Wall Street rating<br><a href="https://coincentral.com/oklo-inc-oklo-stock-shares-slide-on-insider-selling-and-goldmans-caution/">coincentral.com</a>.</p>
<p>Several insiders (including the CEO, CFO, and board members) sold chunks of shares, which, while planned, spooked the market<br><a href="https://coincentral.com/oklo-inc-oklo-stock-shares-slide-on-insider-selling-and-goldmans-caution/">coincentral.com</a>.</p>
<p>Then Goldman Sachs initiated coverage with a neutral rating and a $117 price target, cautioning that Oklo’s valuation had “run far ahead of fundamentals” and flagging its unproven technology and long road to revenue. This one-two punch of insider sales and sober analyst commentary punctured some of the hype.</p>
<p>Even after the dip, Oklo remains up over 1000% year-on-year, so sentiment could swing wildly on any news. In short, Oklo has become highly speculative, trading more on story than substance at this stage.</p>
<h2 id="outlook--risks-1">Outlook &amp; Risks</h2>
<p>There’s no denying Oklo’s bold vision and the massive upside if it executes (the Switch deal alone, if fully realized, implies hundreds of reactors and steady cash flows). Oklo is also relatively well-funded post-SPAC and has an enviable roster of allies.</p>
<p>But investors must grapple with fundamental risks: no reactor is built yet, no NRC license in hand, and no revenue likely until 2027+. Oklo will burn cash on development and could need to raise more capital if timelines slip – raising dilution risk down the line.</p>
<p>The regulatory hurdle is significant: Oklo’s fast reactor is a new type for the NRC, and the company will need to convincingly demonstrate safety to avoid the fate of its first application.</p>
<p>Execution risk is high too; building a first-of-kind microreactor by 2027 is a tight schedule, and any delays could erode the market’s patience given the current lofty valuation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Oklo’s stock now prices in heroic outcomes. As Goldman noted, enthusiasm has been “catalyst-driven” – meaning if anticipated catalysts (like a permanent license, a new big contract, etc.) are delayed or disappoint, the stock could see sharp corrections.</p>
<p>In essence, Oklo offers huge upside potential (it aspires to be a profitable nuclear utility selling power across sectors) but comes with equally huge execution and valuation risk. It’s a long-term bet that today’s nuclear renaissance truly materializes – and that Oklo will be one of its first big winners.</p>

<h1 id="terrapower--private-fast-reactor-venture-with-gigantic-backing-bill-gates">TerraPower – Private Fast Reactor Venture with Gigantic Backing (Bill Gates)</h1>
<p>TerraPower is a heavyweight in advanced nuclear, founded by Bill Gates and a cadre of scientists in 2006. While not publicly traded, it’s on every nuclear investor’s radar given its cutting-edge Natrium reactor and deep funding.</p>
<p>Natrium is a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor paired with an innovative molten salt heat storage system – it can flex its output to 500 MWe for peak periods by dumping heat from the salt storage to a steam generator<br><a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/">powermag.com</a>.</p>
<p>This design, co-developed with GE Hitachi, aims to marry nuclear reliability with grid flexibility (load-following). TerraPower is also pursuing a molten-chloride fast reactor and has a medical isotopes division, but Natrium is its flagship.</p>
<h2 id="timeline--demo-project">Timeline &amp; Demo Project</h2>
<p>TerraPower, in partnership with utility PacifiCorp, is building a Natrium demonstration plant in Kemmerer, Wyoming, at the site of a retiring coal plant. Initially the target was to have it running by 2028, but a major setback hit: the specialized HALEU fuel for Natrium was supposed to come from Russia. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that supply was cut off, and domestic HALEU production is only just ramping up.</p>
<p>As a result, TerraPower announced a roughly 2-year delay to 2030 for the demo plant launch<br><a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/">powermag.com</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, TerraPower began early construction activities (non-nuclear infrastructure) in 2022–2023, and by 2024 it submitted its construction permit application to the NRC<br><a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/">powermag.com</a>.<br>Licensing is reportedly on track, and TerraPower remains confident the Kemmerer reactor will operate by 2030<br><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/first-terrapower-advanced-reactor-schedule-fuel-concern-2024-05-09/">reuters.com</a>.</p>
<p>The company is actively working on the HALEU issue – for instance, the DOE awarded contracts to enrichers like Centrus to domestically produce HALEU, and initial batches are expected by mid-decade.</p>
<h2 id="funding--partnerships">Funding &amp; Partnerships</h2>
<p>TerraPower is funded like a tech unicorn. It raised an $750 million round in 2022 (led by Gates and SK Group of Korea), and importantly it won a $1.9 billion ARDP award from the U.S. DOE<br><a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/">powermag.com</a>.</p>
<p>Under this cost-share, DOE picks up half the Natrium demo cost – a huge subsidy. The project’s engineering, procurement, and construction is being handled by Bechtel, a top nuclear EPC firm. GE Hitachi is a key technology partner. PacifiCorp (owned by Berkshire Hathaway) is the utility hosting the demo.</p>
<p>TerraPower’s separate program, the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) with Southern Company, achieved operation at Idaho Lab, marking the first fission in a molten salt reactor in the U.S. – a stepping stone for future designs.</p>
<h2 id="status--big-picture">Status / Big Picture</h2>
<p>As a private company, TerraPower’s financials aren’t public, but it’s clearly in R&amp;D mode. It will rely on continued support from Gates and government grants to reach completion. With the demonstration plant scheduled by 2030, revenue from selling power or additional reactors won’t flow until next decade.</p>
<p>For investors, TerraPower isn’t directly accessible via stock today. One can look for indirect exposure via partners/supply-chain firms.</p>
<p>TerraPower’s risks are largely technical and geopolitical: ensuring the sodium reactor works as intended, and securing enough fuel in time. TerraPower said construction is on a “predictable schedule” with “construction complete in 2030”<br><a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/">powermag.com</a>.</p>

<h1 id="x-energy--high-temperature-modular-reactors-with-big-deals-private-plan-to-go-public">X-energy – High-Temperature Modular Reactors with Big Deals (Private, Plan to Go Public)</h1>
<p>X-energy is focused on HTGR (High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors). Its signature design, the Xe-100, is an 80 MWe pebble-bed reactor deployed in packs of four.</p>
<p>The Xe-100 uses TRISO fuel and outputs high-temperature heat (~600°C) in addition to power.</p>
<p>X-energy has strong government support: it was a co-winner of the DOE’s ARDP demo funding (awarded ~$1.2 billion) to build four Xe-100 units in Washington state by 2030.</p>
<h2 id="timeline--projects-1">Timeline &amp; Projects</h2>
<p>The ARDP demonstration is in collaboration with Energy Northwest and is slated for the Hanford site in Washington, aiming for operation around 2028–2030. X-energy hit a licensing milestone in March 2025 by submitting a Construction Permit application to the NRC. The NRC docketed the application and set an accelerated review schedule.</p>
<p>Private-sector partner: <strong>Dow Inc.</strong> Plans to deploy a four-pack at a Gulf Coast manufacturing site (Seadrift, Texas) to provide process heat and power.</p>
<p>Amazon partnership: Amazon, utility partner Constellation, and X-energy announced plans to develop up to 5 GW of nuclear power by 2039, with Amazon investing to help deploy X-energy reactors<br><a href="https://www.powermag.com/understanding-terrapowers-natrium-reactor-design-and-demonstration-project-progress/">powermag.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="funding--path-to-public-market">Funding &amp; Path to Public Market</h2>
<p>X-energy planned a SPAC merger in 2023 at a $2B valuation; it was terminated. It secured bridge financing and may pursue an IPO/other route when markets improve.</p>
<p>X-energy owns TRISO-X, building a TRISO fuel fabrication facility in Tennessee.</p>
<h2 id="outlook--risks-2">Outlook &amp; Risks</h2>
<p>Typical advanced-reactor risks: technology, licensing, funding. The collapse of the SPAC deal means reliance on private funding longer. Partners like Dow/Amazon provide credibility and potential financing leverage.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion-hype-vs-reality-in-the-nuclear-renaissance">Conclusion: Hype vs. Reality in the Nuclear Renaissance</h1>
<p>In the past six months, the mini-reactor sector has seen soaring stock prices, bold government bets, and growing mainstream recognition. The narrative that “nuclear is back” – driven by energy security needs, climate goals, and the insatiable power demands of AI – has real substance. Multiple projects are under construction or close.</p>
<p>Major corporations outside utilities (Amazon, Dow, Google, Microsoft) are endorsing nuclear. However, investors must disentangle hype from reality. Oklo’s valuation bakes in huge success; NuScale is still pre-profit and must convert MOUs into binding orders.</p>
<p>Analysts urge caution: Goldman’s neutral take on Oklo flagged stretched valuation; NuScale moved toward Hold with targets near current price<br><a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SMR/forecast/">marketbeat.com</a>.</p>
<p>Policy support is stronger than in decades (IRA credits, DOE funding, regulatory acceleration), but projects still face opposition, supply chain, and real build risk.</p>
<p>Near-term catalysts to watch (6–12 months):</p>
<ul>
<li>NuScale: binding orders (UAMPS/Romania/TVA program conversion)</li>
<li>Oklo: NRC docketing/licensing progress, financing (DOE loan)</li>
<li>Rolls: contracts, site, licensing progress, factory setup</li>
<li>GEH: Canada schedule/budget performance</li>
</ul>
<p>The nuclear renaissance is real, but not uniform. Some companies will fail or dilute heavily; others could become energy giants. The mini-nuclear gold rush has begun; which companies strike gold becomes clearer each quarter.</p>
